The java.util.concurrent.locks package provides a framework of interfaces and classes for locking and waiting for conditions in a manner that’s distinct from an object’s intrinsic lock-based synchronization and java.lang.Object’s wait/notification mechanism. The concurrency utilities include the Locking Framework that improves on  intrinsic synchronization and wait/notification by offering lock polling, timed waits, and more.
