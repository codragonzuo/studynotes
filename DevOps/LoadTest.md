# Continuous Load Testing

 
Tricentis Flood is built to enable load testing for DevOps, helping DevTest teams gain performance feedback rapidly and continuously. In addition to supporting industry-leading load testing tools, Flood integrates with
Tricentis Tosca—allowing users to perform load testing with the same scriptless tests they use for functional testing.


• With teams moving to more componentized applications (including cloud-native apps, microservices, etc.), an application involves many highly-distributed components—and a performance issue in any of them
could have a ripple effect across the entire application

• Now that new functionality is being released weekly, daily, or hourly, each team needs instant insight into
whether their incremental changes negatively impact performance 

• The later you start load testing, the more difficult, time-consuming, and costly it is to expose, debug, and
resolve performance problems

In-depth load testing by performance testing specialists remains critical—but it doesn’t provide the level of fast, ondemand load testing that’s critical for Agile and DevOps. Developers and testers need a way to expose critical
performance issues before new functionality progresses through the delivery pipeline. To achieve this, they must be able to easily:

• Create load tests that provide fast feedback on the functionality they’re evolving

• Execute and scale those load tests as needed—without the exorbitant costs and efforts traditionally
required to establish, configure, and maintain a performance test lab
