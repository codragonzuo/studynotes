- software performance
   -  Design efficiency
       - Algorithms and data structures
       - Program decomposition
   -  Coding efficiency
       - Language constructs
       - System architecture
       - Libraries
       - Compiler optimizations
   
Programmers may have different views on C++ performance depending on their respective experiences. 
But there are a few basic principles that we all agree on: 

 - I/O is expensive. 
 - Function call overhead is a factor so we should inline short, frequently called functions. 
 - Copying objects is expensive. Prefer pass-by-reference over pass-by-value.
