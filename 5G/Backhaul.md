Backhaul

Backhaul（回程线路），也叫做信号隧道，是一个配置，在那里电话信令是一个网关到另一个媒体网关通过一个分组交换网络的可靠传输。这个网关不需要理解和解释这个信令信息。移动网络的RAN层传输网络，通常被称为Mobile Backhaul Transport Network，指通过多种物理媒介在基站（BS）和基站控制器（BSC）之间建立一个安全可靠的电路传输手段。

介绍

在无线技术中，回程（backhaul）指的是从信源站点向交换机传送语音和数据流量的功能。

发展

移动网络的RAN层传输网络，通常被称为Mobile Backhaul Transport Network，指通过多种物理媒介在基站（BS）和基站控制器（BSC）之间建立一个安全可靠的电路传输手段。所有的客户终端通过RAN接入移动网络、获得移动业务，因此Backhaul的网络质量直接影响运营商是否能够快速响应业务发展需求；是否能够提供更加可靠的网络业务；是否能够进一步降低网络建设成本；是否能够降低网络的运行维护成本；从而进一步影响运营成绩。

随着运营成本压力的逐步增加和数据业务发展带来的带宽压力，Backhaul传输的优化成为运营商最为关注的热点问题。但是Backhaul的传输优化，不是一个简单的增加投资、扩大建设的问题，而要从多个方面进行考虑，诸如网络拓扑、传输媒介、带宽资源、网元类型等。只有进行全面的考虑，才能找到最佳的解决方案。

Backhaul, a term probably derived from the trucking industry, has several usages in information technology.

1) In satellite communication, backhaul is used to mean getting data to a point from which it can be distributed over a network. For example, to deliver a live television program from Chicago to authorized DirecPC satellite terminals around the country, the video signals would have to be backhauled by some means (by optical fiber cable or by another satellite system) to the Hughes DirecPC facility in Germantown, Maryland. From there, it would be uplinked to the Galaxy IV satellite from which DirecPC users could view the broadcast (receive it in a downlink from the satellite at their individual terminals). Backhauling is also used to get non-live audio and video material to distribution points at the major broadcast news organizations for broadcast in the evening or ongoing news.


2) Manufacturers of network switching equipment use the term to mean "getting data to the network backbone" (which is similar to its use in the satellite communication industry). For example, Ascend uses the term to describe how its MAX 2000 switch can be used to interconnect data from a backhaul T-1 line on which mobile and remote office users are connected to an Internet service provider and the backbone of the Internet.

3) According to books we like, backhauling is sending network data over an out-of-the-way route (including taking it farther than its destination) in order to get the data there sooner or because it costs less. This kind of backhauling involves understanding changing network conditions and economics.

4) Backhauling may sometimes be used to mean the use of the back channel on a bidirectional communications line.
