Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

Mongoose is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to move data between your application and MongoDB databases. It is a layer of abstraction that allows you to create schemas for the data that your application uses, and provides facilities for connecting to MongoDB and validating, saving, updating, deleting and retrieving instances of these schemas.
