## ROS

### What is ROS?
ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management. 

It also provides tools and libraries for obtaining, building, writing, and running code across multiple computers.
