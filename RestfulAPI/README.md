Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) standard an XML language defining a message architecture and message formats, is used by Web services it contain a description of the operations. WSDL is an XML-based language for describing Web services and how to access them. will run on SMTP,HTTP,FTP etc. Requires middleware support, well defined mechanisam to define services like WSDL+XSD, WS-Policy SOAP will return XML based data

REST Representational State Transfer (RESTful) web services. they are second generation Web Services. RESTful web services, communicate via HTTP than SOAP-based services and do not require XML messages or WSDL service-API definitions. for REST no middleware is required only HTTP support is needed.WADL Standard, REST can return XML, plain text, JSON, HTML etc

There are two major types of web services:

SOAP Web Services: SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an XML-based protocol for accessing web services. Its interface is described in a machine-processable format called WSDL (Web Service Definition Language) document. A web service is described by using a standard, formal XML notion that provides all necessary details like message format, transport protocols, and location to interact with the web service.

REST Web Services: REST (Representational State Transfer) is a style of software architecture. The data format is described by using JSON schema notation, and it requires the use of the HTTP transport protocol.
